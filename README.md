🥗 Food Waste Analysis - EDA Project
Welcome to my first Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This repository contains my work on Food Waste Analysis, where I dive into the dataset sourced from Kaggle to uncover patterns, trends, and insights about food wastage.

🌟 Project Overview
Food waste is a critical issue that impacts food security, environmental sustainability, and global economics. This analysis aims to provide insights into food wastage trends, factors affecting waste, and potential recommendations to address the problem.

🔍 Objectives:
Understand the scope and scale of food wastage globally.
Identify patterns and trends in the data.
Visualize key findings to communicate results effectively.
